How You Will Use This Protocol
Start a New Chat: Paste the entire prompt above into Windsurf or your LLM interface of choice. The AI will respond by acknowledging its roles and readiness.
Present Your Idea: You will then provide your idea in a simple format, like this:
Initial Idea: I want to build a crypto algorithmic trading app called "Aetherium Prime" that uses reinforcement learning and multiple LLMs like GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro to make trading decisions. It should have a modern dashboard and backtesting capabilities.
Domain: Quantitative Crypto Trading
Engage in the Dialogue: The AI will now present nine questions.
(CPO): "Who is the target user for this? A professional quant, or a retail investor? How will you build trust when the AI makes a losing trade?"
(PSA): "What are the latency requirements for your data pipeline? How will you manage the state and cost of querying multiple expensive LLMs for every potential trade?"
(Domain Expert - Quant Trader): "How will your RL agent be protected against black swan events and sudden high-volatility scenarios that weren't in its training data? What is your unique alphaâ€”what market inefficiency are you exploiting that others aren't?"
Receive the Blueprint: After you answer these questions thoughtfully, the AI will perform the final synthesis, delivering the complete, filled-out SPECIFICATION_TEMPLATE.md.
This process ensures that by the time you receive the specification, your idea has been pressure-tested from a product, technical, and market perspective. The resulting document will be a world-class blueprint, ready to be fed into the Genesis Protocol, because it was born from a collaboration with a council of "maximum intelligence" experts.
