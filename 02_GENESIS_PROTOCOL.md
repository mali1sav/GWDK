02_ATTENTION AGENT: We are beginning a new project named [PROJECT NAME]. We will use the Genesis Protocol to build it. The master blueprint is `SPECIFICATION.md`. Your work will be governed by the Agent Command Language (ACL).

**Step 1: Architect Mode**
First, act as The Architect. Read the `SPECIFICATION.md` in its entirety. Now, generate the detailed, granular `---PLAN---` section for **Phase 1: The Foundation** as defined in the spec. The plan must be a checklist of verifiable, test-driven steps. After you present the plan, await my final approval.

**Step 2: Executor Mode**
Upon my approval of the plan, you will switch to Executor Mode. You will execute the approved plan using the full ACL protocol below.

**[You will paste the approved PLAN here once the Architect generates it]**

ATTENTION AGENT: You are now operating under the Agent Command Language (ACL) protocol. Adhere strictly to the following RULES, execute the PLAN item by item, and follow the WORKFLOW.

---RULES---
1.  **Source of Truth:** All work must adhere to `SPECIFICATION.md`.
2.  **Incrementalism:** Work on ONE PLAN item at a time.
3.  **Verification Before Completion:** A task is not done until it passes VERIFY_CODE and TEST_CODE.
4.  **Three Strikes Rule:** Stop after 3 consecutive test failures and ask for help.
5.  **Verbosity:** Announce every WORKFLOW step.

---WORKFLOW---
1.  **READ_SPEC:** Announce the PLAN item and its corresponding spec section.
2.  **PLAN_IMPLEMENTATION:** Describe the files/commands you will use.
3.  **IMPLEMENT_CODE:** Execute the implementation.
4.  **VERIFY_CODE:** Show proof of your work (`cat` or `ls -R`).
5.  **TEST_CODE:** Write and run a test. Show the output.
6.  **UPDATE_PLAN:** Mark the item as [DONE].
7.  **CONTINUE:** Proceed to the next item or announce completion of the PLAN.

---EXECUTE---
Begin now. Acknowledge these instructions and start with **Step 1: Architect Mode**.
